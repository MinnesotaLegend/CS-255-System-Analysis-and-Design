# CS-255 System Analysis and Design
## DriverPass Project Portfolio Reflection

### Project Summary
The DriverPass project involved designing a system for a client named DriverPass, a company that wanted to help students better prepare for their driving exams. The client needed a web-based system that would allow customers to register, schedule driving lessons, access study materials, and complete online practice exams. The system also needed administrative functionality for managing instructors, schedules, and payments.

#### What I did Well
One area I did particularly well was translating the client's business requirements into clear system components and UML diagrams. I focused on making sure that user interactions, scheduling processes, and error handling were clearly represented in the system design. I also ensured that the documentation was organized and professional.

### What I Would Improve
If I could revise one part of my work, I would refine some of my UML diagrams to improve layout and readability. While they accurately represent system behavior, adjusting spacing and simplifying some flows would make them easier to follow viusally.

### Interpreting User Needs
I interepreted the user's needs by carefully reviewing the business requirements and indentifying both functional and nonfunctional requirements. I then incorporated those needs into use cases, activity diagrams, sequence diagrams, and system architecture decisions. Considering user needs is critical because a system is only successful if it solves the user's problem effeciently and provides a positive experience.

#### My Approach to Designing Software
When designing software, I start by understanding the problem from the user's perspective. I then break the system into components and model interactions using UML diagrams. In the future, I will continue using techniques such as requirement analysis, modeling, and iterative refinement to ensure systems are clear, scalable, and maintainable.
